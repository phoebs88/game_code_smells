Some where around 70,000 points the blocks stopped dropping, but would respond to moves so I could still press down and they would shoot to the bottom.

I hit this myself! I remember I pressed down to plummet a block, which caused a tetromino to disappear and then cascaded to remove a second tetromino. That's when blocks stopped falling but I was still able to drop them manually and get a new block to enter up top.

Happens after a 4 cascade

Basic setup of blocks as reported by @xLeachimx:

```
U
  UUUO
  OOOU
  UUUO
  OOOU
  UUUO
```

The top right O is left over after the cascades finish, and the next active block does not drop on its own. Without the top right O block, all the blocks disappear and the next active block drops on its own. So having that top right O makes the bug appear. Working on it.
